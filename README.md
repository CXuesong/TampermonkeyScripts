# TampermonkeyScripts
A collection of Tampermonkey scripts authored or edited by me.

To try out the scripts in this repository, you need to have [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) plugin installed for your browsers. After installing the plugin, you can install any JS files into it via dashboard. After restarting your browser, the scripts should take effects.

As for the descriptions of each script, see the `README.md` files in the sub-directories.

If you come across any problems or suggestions, feel free to open an Issue for this repository with the name of script.
